# Philadelphia-Bike-Theft-Analysis
Taking a closer look at the dataset on OpenDataPhilly using R


Studies have shown that there are patterns behind bicycle thefts. Some factors include
daylight/darkness, geographic location, and characteristics of the bicycle. The goal of this analysis
is to see what insights can be drawn and confirmed by previous studies using packages in R.

The dataset can be found here: https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/bicycle-thefts

## Getting started

If you'd like to run this yourself, all code can be found in `Analysis.R`
  Make sure to have all packages installed.
  
Otherwise, take a look at my findings in `Report.md`

Data was pulled from `fromJSON("https://data.phila.gov/resource/pbdj-svpx.geojson")`
